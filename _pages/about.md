Hello! 

My name is Satarupa Bhattacharjee. I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Florida. Before this I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Statistics at the Pennsylvania State University, working with [Prof. Bing Li](https://science.psu.edu/stat/people/bxl9) and [Prof. Lingzhou Xue](https://lingzhou-xue.github.io/) from 2022-2024. I received my PhD in Statistics at UC Davis advised by [Prof. Hans-Georg MÃ¼ller](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/) in September 2022.<br>

My primary research centers around analyzing **functional and non-Euclidean data** situated in general metric spaces, which we refer to as *random objects*,  with examples in brain imaging data, networks, distribution valued data, and high-dimensional omics data. Here are links to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&tzom=300&user=2o9ZvksAAAAJ) and my <a href="/assets/pdf/CV_Satarupa.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>. <br>

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, music, and watching soccer.
